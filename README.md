# Free Virtual Machine Cloud Hosting

This repository gathers informations on how to get your own Cloud hosted Virtual Machine (VM) for free.

> For example, if you want to host a Minecraft server for free 24/7, so you can play with your friends, and even run other services.

_If this documentation becomes deprecated, note that it's possible to self-host a service on your machine and to do **[TCP tunnelling with ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/tcp/)**. However, the generated URL for TCP endpoints is ephemeral if you choose the free plan._
